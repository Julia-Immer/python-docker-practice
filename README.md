# A Project For Practicing Docker and CI/CD Tools
A very simple practice Dockerfile which runs a python app.

Soon to become, a musical synthesizer app, developed Dockerfile-first to use containerization and build tools.

## Build And Run This App

cd into this folder.
`docker build -t synth-in-docker .`
`docker run -it -t synth-in-docker`
